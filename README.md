# Glass-Cup
This is a simple 3d model I created in Blender following an online guide on how to create a glass material and apply it to an object. 
I renedered it in Cycles for better results with the model, lighting and material. 


Both the Model and Material are free to use!
In the future I will update the model to have break-able properties such as shattering for further use in video or game design.


The cup is on a red background to instill the powerful feeling that one has when holding a delicate glass object in their hand.
